# Tabajara Nutri
 My first project built in java using Java swing / Window Builder    
 **Language** = Portuguese :brazil:

:bust_in_silhouette:**User** = Tabajara    
:key:**Password** = SenhaFoda6969


This project is just a mockup of a nutrition clinic that i made as a school project.    
I implemented a:   
* :closed_lock_with_key:Login System     
* :lock:Password encryption system  
* :white_check_mark:Simple validation for email and pacient code (just checks if it is allready registered)  
* :page_facing_up:Save all user imput into a .txt file  


**Quick notes:**    
i know there is a lot to improve in this, but as my first experience with java swing and window builder, i'm really proud on where i could get to.
